## Contribution Process
### Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues
Reporting bugs is one of the most helpful ways to contribute to Pixie. Bugs may be reported by filing a Github issue in the appropriate repository. For bugs regarding Pixie, file an issue in the `pixie` repo. For reporting inaccurate documentation, file an issue in the `pixie-docs` repo, etc. Please follow the template when filing an issue and provide as much information as possible.

Before reporting a bug, we encourage you to search the existing Github issues to ensure that the bug has not already been filed. 

### Code Contributions
The project is still in its early stages, and we are a small team actively working on delivering our roadmap. For all changes, regardless of size, please create a Github issue that details the bug or feature being addressed before submitting a pull request. In the Github issue, contributors may discuss the viability of the solution, alternatives, and considerations. 

#### Contribution Roadmap
As we are still an early-stage open source project, more changes to the contribution guidelines will follow in the coming months. We are actively working on opening our JIRA for issue tracking.

#### Contribution Flow
1. Steps to making a code contribution to Pixie will generally look like the following:

5. Push your branch to your fork.
6. Submit a pull request to the original repository.

### Building from source: front-end
Once the repo has been cloned, please:

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

2. Build plugin in development mode or run in watch mode

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   yarn watch
   ```

3. Build plugin in production mode

   ```bash
   yarn build
   ```

### Building from source: back-end

1. Update [Grafana plugin SDK for Go](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/plugins/backend/grafana-plugin-sdk-for-go/) dependency to the latest minor version:

   ```bash
   go get -u github.com/grafana/grafana-plugin-sdk-go
   ```

2. Build backend plugin binaries for Linux, Windows and Darwin:

   ```bash
   mage -v
   ```

3. List all available Mage targets for additional commands:

   ```bash
   mage -l
   ```   
4. Please ensure that your Grafana configuration file is appropriately 
edited to detect the plugin binaries. Additional details [here](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/administration/configuration/).
